# CNN Image Classification
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vision that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).
